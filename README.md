All the angles were measured in degree. If the angle measure is greater than 90 degree, the supplementary angle is used for plotting.
The array of angles was written in one column and saved in csv file under the name "data_array.csv" and put in the same folder as the code.

The plot is then exported in .svg file and saved in folder "images" under name "fig2.svg". The "images" folder is found in the same folder as the code and the data array.
